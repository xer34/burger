Coding Bootcamp burger by Alexander Lewis

burger is a full stack food app. The app allows the user to devour items on the burger menu, and add/edit and remove burgers from the menu.

This app is useful to learn the principals of tying a full stack together. burgerTime uses Mysql, Express, Handlebars and Node.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however Alex may be contacted through his website for help or questions regarding the project.
